## Rules of Matching Game
- You will start by flipping(clicking) over one card
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
- These cards then disappear
- If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of this and the cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
